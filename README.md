# Bloggy: A Simple Blog Web Application  

**Goal**  
The goal of this project is to create a blog web application using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions since no database is used in this version. The project focuses on functionality and user-friendly styling.
